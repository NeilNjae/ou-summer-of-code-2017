# ou-summer-of-code-2017

This is a repository of questions and sample solutions for the "Summer of Code 2017" programming contest run in the Open University (OU) in July 2017. The contest was only available to OU students. We're posting this as a service to the students, allowing them to see our solutions after the contest has ended. 

While all the solutions work, they weren't written for external consumption, so the code is likely to be less than elegant and less than readable! In particular, there are almost no comments in the code.

Github should render the solution notebooks, but seems to have some bugs. If the first link doesn't work for you, try the NbViewer one.
