    "\n",
    "Luckily, you know how their system works. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each door in the hotel has a keyboard on the lock. You have to enter the correct two-letter code to get in to the room. Because the staff know that people won't remember the codes, they tell you a pass phrase you can use the generate the code from.\n",

    "3. Move on to the next letter of the pass phrase\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Adding\" letters is done by converting the letters to their position in the alphabet (starting at one), adding, then converting the number back to a letter. Numbers greater than 26 are \"wrapped around\". For instance, to add `u` + `k`, convert them to numbers (`u`=`21`, `k`=`11`), add them (`21` + `11` = `32`), then convert back to a letter (`32` is larger than 26, so it becomes `32` - 26 = `6`, which is `f`).\n",
