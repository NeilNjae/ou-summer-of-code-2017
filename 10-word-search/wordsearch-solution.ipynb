    "With a standard string or list, Python (along with many other languages) has the idea of a _slice_: a section of the list identified by its start position and length. The function `gslice` (for \"grid slice\") does the same thing: return a slice of grid, defined by starting row and column, length, and direction. All `gslice` does is return the cell called out by `indices`. `indices` uses the `delta` dict to convert the direction into the row and column changes, and also does the bounds checking to only return (row, column) pairs that are in the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "`present_many` just does an exhaustive search of the grid, finding all possible grid slices (all rows, column, directions, and valid lengths) and checking if the slice returned is one of the given words. \n",
    "\n",
    "(There's another version of `present_many` that uses comprehensions to find the words, but that's slower as it keeps having to call `gslice` and `indices` for checking.)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Worked solution: Part 2\n",
    "This builds on part 1. First, I find all the words. I then take all those word positions and, on a copy of the grid, replace the characters in the word position with dots, using the `set_grid` procedure. Then it's just a matter of concatenating the grid into one long string, filtering to keep only the vowels, and counting how many there are."
